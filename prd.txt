Product Requirements Document: SEAP
Project Overview
SEAP is a platform to educate users about phishing and social engineering. It does so via interactive, simulated campaigns, all within a safe and ethical environment. Both learners (students/employees) and admins have distinct roles ensuring safety, education, and accountability.

1. Goals & Objectives
Teach users to recognize and react appropriately to phishing attempts.

Offer hands-on, safe simulation without storing sensitive information.

Empower admins to moderate content and oversee campaign safety.

2. Stakeholders & Roles
Normal Users: Register, create campaigns, share links, view analytics, learn from feedback.

Admins: Approve/reject campaigns, monitor the system, view audit logs, manage users.

3. Functional Requirements
1. User Registration & Authentication
Support sign-up via email and password.

Email verification or OTP for login confirmation.

Differentiate between admin and normal users at registration.

JWT-based authentication for secure sessions.

2. User Profile Management
Users can update email, password.

Admins can view all registered users.

Option for user deletion/report by admin.

3. Campaign Management
Users can create campaigns with:

Title, description

Email text simulation

Fake landing page link

Expiry date

Campaign status: Pending, Approved, Rejected

Admin panel for reviewing submitted campaigns

Approval/rejection workflow with comments

4. Phishing Simulation System
Unique tracking links generated per campaign.

Landing page mimics phishing attempt (no real data captured).

Email simulation via copy-paste or mock sender.

After interaction, redirect to awareness page.

Strict measures to prevent real data misuse.

5. Event Tracking & Logging
Log these events: link opened, clicked, fake form submitted, awareness page viewed.

Timestamp each event, associate with campaign and user.

6. Awareness & Education Page
Display when users “fall” for simulation.

Explain phishing techniques, signs, and cybersecurity tips.

Suggest best practices visually and textually.

7. Admin Panel
Approve/reject campaigns (with reason).

View active/archived campaigns and their stats.

Manage users (view, delete, report).

Access audit logs of all admin actions.

View leaderboard — top campaign creators by engagement.

8. Leaderboard & Gamification
Leaderboard based on:

Most campaign clicks

Most awareness conversions

Least admin rejections

Badges/levels (optional): “Phish Creator,” “Cyber Aware,” etc.

9. Analytics Dashboard
Visualizations: campaigns/user, clicks vs. awareness rate, event timeline, campaign type distributions.

Filter data by date, user, campaign status.

10. Audit Logs & Security Layer
Admin actions recorded: approval, rejection, deletions.

Data validation/sanitization on inputs.

No sensitive credential storage.

Approval before campaign goes live.

Tracking tokens for events, not personal data.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: Responsive UI for analytics, dashboard.

Security: Strict access controls, no real credential storage.

Scalability: Support hundreds of simultaneous users.

Auditability: All admin actions are tracked.

Privacy/Ethics: All simulations are safe; no malicious intent can be executed.

5. Step-by-Step Workflow (for Coding & Demo)
Phase 1: Authentication & User Management
Implement registration, login with JWT/OTP.

User roles: normal, admin.

Profile management for users and user listing for admins.

Phase 2: Campaign Module
Campaign creation form for users.

Backend for storing campaign metadata.

Admin campaign review dashboard for approval/rejection.

Workflow transitions: Pending → Approved/Rejected.

Phase 3: Phishing Simulation Engine
Unique token-based campaign links.

Landing page mockups.

Logging click/submission events.

Phase 4: Awareness & Education Experience
Awareness page triggered after simulated phishing “fall.”

Educational content with actionable tips.

Phase 5: Event Tracking & Analytics
Backend event logs for all interactions.

Analytics dashboard showing campaign performance.

Phase 6: Admin Panel & Audit Logs
Campaign moderation workflow for admins.

Admin user management.

View audit logs and leaderboard.

Phase 7: Leaderboard & Gamification
Algorithm to rank users by campaign performance.

Optional badge and levels assignment.

Phase 8: Testing & Security Review
Test all flows for edge cases.

Pen-test for data misuse prevention.

Review input sanitization and event logging.

6. Final Deliverables
User authentication system with role differentiation

Campaign creation and approval workflow

Unique, shareable simulation links

Event tracking (clicks, conversions, awareness)

Awareness page with educational content

Admin dashboard and audit logs

Leaderboard and analytics dashboard
